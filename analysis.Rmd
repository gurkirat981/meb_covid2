Notes:

1. This document contains aggregate graphs for all survey questions weighted by share of IAS officers in each state.

2. Questions 13 which asked "Dealing with any pandemic of this scale is a collective responsibility and everyone has a part to play. However, in the final analysis, who do you think must shoulder a greater share of responsibility for any shortcomings?" has been
excluded from the analysis because we received only partial responses.

3. Questions 4,5 and 6 can be depicted at the time of design using a map of India with colour markers indicating the percentage of responses that each state received

4. Sample: Number of responses from serving officers = 452,  Number of responses from former officers = 96

5. Of the serving officers who responded to this survey, 147 (33%) had also filled last year's survey while 305 officers (67%) responded to our survey for the first time.

6. Of the former officers who responded to this survey, 25 (26%) also participated in our survey last year while 71 (74%) filled our survey for the first time this year.

## Question 3: Disaggregated by SDG

In our survey of IAS officers during the first wave of the pandemic, almost 70% of officers felt that there was a reasonable to substantial increase in health system preparedness post the nationwide lockdown. Which of these statements best reflects health system preparedness for the second wave?
